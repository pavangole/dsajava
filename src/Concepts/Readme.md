## Daily Learning Journal

- **Issue**: Sometimes, I forget basic concepts, or I'm unsure of how to accomplish certain tasks.

- **Plan**: I will maintain a daily learning journal to keep track of concepts I struggle with.

- **Action**: Every day, I will list down the specific concepts or tasks I had difficulty with, and my attempts to understand or master them.

By maintaining this journal, I aim to enhance my understanding and knowledge.
